# FizzBuzz
1. Go through numbers 1 to 1000 (inclusive):
  1. If the number is evenly divisible by 3, print (to the standard output) `Fizz`
  2. If the number is divisible by 5, print `Buzz`
  3. If the number is both divisible by 3 and 5, print `FizzBuzz` 
  4. If none of the cases apply, print the original number.

*Hint:* Ensure that your output only uses (`\n`) line endings,
and ends in a new line.
